      "Our God and Father, we respond anew",

      "He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise;",

    "v3": [
      "Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son,",
      "We have our part in joy before Thy face;",

      "Sons loved and loving, whom Thy Spirit fills,",
      "Our endless portion Christ in us to be;",
      "Each with some trait of Him whose love us thrills,",
      "For Thy delight and joy eternally."
