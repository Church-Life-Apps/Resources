    "v1": [
      "Does Jesus care when my heart is pained",
      "Too deeply for mirth and song,",
      "As the burdens press, and the cares distress,",
      "And the way grows weary and long?"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Does Jesus care when my way is dark",
      "With a nameless dread and fear?",
      "As the daylight fades into deep night shades,",
      "Does He care enough to be near?"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed",
      "To resist some temptation strong;",

      "Tho' my tears flow all the night long?"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Does Jesus care when I've said \"goodbye\"",
      "To the dearest on earth to me,",
      "And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks\u2014",
      "Is it aught to Him? Does He see?"
    ],
    "c1": [
      "O yes, He cares, I know He cares!",
      "His heart is touched with my grief;",
      "When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,",
      "I know my Savior cares."
