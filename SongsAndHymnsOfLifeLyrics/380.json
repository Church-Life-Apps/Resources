    "v1": [
      "O Word of God incarnate,",
      "O Wisdom from on high,",
      "O Truth unchanged, unchanging,",
      "O Light of our dark sky,",
      "We praise Thee for the radiance",
      "That from the hallowed page,",
      "A lantern to our footsteps,",
      "Shines on from age to age."

      "The Church from You, our Savior",
      "Received the gift divine,",
      "And still that light she lifteth",
      "O'er all the earth to shine:",
      "It is a golden casket",
      "Where gems of truth are stored;",
      "It is the heav'n drawn picture",
      "Of Christ, the living Word."

    "v3": [
      "It floateth like a banner",
      "Before God's host unfurled;",
      "It shineth like a beacon",
      "Above the darkling world;",
      "It is the chart and compass",
      "That, o'er life's surging sea,",
      "'Mid mists and rocks and quick-sands",
      "Still guides, O Christ, to Thee."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "O make Thy Church, dear Savior,",
      "A lamp of burnished gold,",
      "To bear before the nations",
      "Thy true light, as of old;",
      "O teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims",
      "By this their path to trace,",
      "Till, clouds and darkness ended,",
      "They see Thee face to face."
