      "Nothing between my soul and the Savior,",

    ],
    "v4": [
      "Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,",
      "Though the whole world against me convene;",
      "Watching with prayer and much self-denial,",
      "I'll triumph at last, there's nothing between."
    ],
    "c1": [
      "Nothing between my soul and the Savior,",
      "So that His blessed face may be seen;",
      "Nothing preventing the least of His favor,",
      "Keep the way clear! Let nothing between."
