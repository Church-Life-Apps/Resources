      "Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,",
      "Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;",
      "Streams of mercy, never ceasing,",
      "Call for songs of loudest praise.",
      "Jesus sought me when a stranger,",

      "Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,",

      "Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;",
      "Prone to leave the God I love;",
      "Take my heart, O take and seal it",
      "With Thy Spirit from above.",
      "Rescued thus from sin and danger,",
      "Purchased by the Savior's blood,",
      "May I walk on earth a stranger,",
      "As a son and heir of God."
