      "Life at best is very brief,",
      "Like the falling of a leaf,",
      "Like the binding of a sheaf,",
      "Be in time!",
      "Fleeting days are telling fast",
      "That the die will soon be cast,",

      "Fairest flowers soon decay,",
      "Youth and beauty pass away;",
      "Oh, you have not long to stay,",

      "While God's Spirit bids you come,",
      "Sinner, do not longer roam,",
      "Lest you seal your hopeless doom,",
      "Be in time!"

      "Time is gliding swiftly by,",
      "Death and judgment draweth nigh,",
      "To the arms of Jesus fly,",
      "Be in time!",
      "Oh, I pray you count the cost!",
      "Ere the fatal line be crossed,",
      "And your soul in hell be lost,",

      "Sinner, heed the warning voice,",

      "You may find no open gate,",
      "And your cry be just too late:",
