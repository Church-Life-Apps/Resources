      "In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide!",
      "Oh, how precious are the lessons which I learn at Jesus' side!",
      "Earthly cares can never vex me, neither trials lay me low;",

      "When my soul is faint and thirsty, 'neath the shadow of His wing",
      "There is cool and pleasant shelter, and a fresh and crystal spring;",
      "And my Savior rests beside me, as we hold communion sweet;",
      "If I tried, I could not utter what He says when thus we meet,",
      "What He says when thus we meet."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Only this I know: I tell Him all my doubts and griefs and fears;",
      "Oh, how patiently He listens, and my drooping soul He cheers;",
      "Do you think He ne'er reproves me? What a false friend He would be,",
      "If He never, never told me of the sins which He must see,",
      "Of the sins which He must see."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Would you like to know that sweetness of the secret of the Lord?",
      "Go and hide beneath His shadow: this shall then be your reward;",
      "And whene'er you leave the silence of that happy meeting place,",
      "You must mind and bear the image of the Master in your face,",
      "Of the Master in your face."
