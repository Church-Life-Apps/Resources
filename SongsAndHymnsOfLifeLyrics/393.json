      "Lord! Let my heart still turn to Thee,",
      "In all my hours of waking thought,",
      "Nor let this heart e'er wish to flee,",
      "Or think, or feel, where Thou art not."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "In every hour of pain and woe,",
      "When nought on earth this heart can cheer,",
      "When sighs will burst and tears will flow,",
      "Lord, hush the sigh and chase the tear."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "In every dream of earthly bliss,",
      "Do Thou, dear Jesus, present be;",
      "Nor let a thought of happiness",
      "On earth intrude, apart from Thee!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "To my last lingering thought at night,",
      "Do Thou, Lord Jesus, still be near;",
      "And ere the dawn of opening light",
      "In still small accents wake mine ear."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Whene'er I read Thy sacred word,",
      "Bright on the page in glory shine;",
      "And let me say, \"This precious Lord",
      "In all His full salvation's mine.\""
    ],
    "v6": [
      "And when before the throne I kneel,",
      "Hear from that throne of grace my prayer,",
      "And let each hope of heav'n I feel",
      "Burn with the thought to meet Thee there."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "Thus teach me, Lord, to look to Thee",
      "In every hour of waking thought,",
      "Nor let me ever wish to be,",
      "Or think, or feel, where Thou art not."
