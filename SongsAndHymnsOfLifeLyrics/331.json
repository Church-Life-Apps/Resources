      "Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,",
      "Wash all my sins away,",
      "That with Thy Holy Spirit",
      "Thou may anoint, I pray.",
      "My service, I confess, Lord,",

      "O Lord, how dry my heart is,",

      "I'll ne'er rebellious be.",
      "I lie upon Thy altar",
      "And dare not move away;",
      "Oh, may Thy flame descending",

      "Oh, may Thy Cross within me",

      "Oh, may Thy Spirit fill me",
      "Each day more than before,",
      "And may Thy living water",
      "On me and through me pour."
