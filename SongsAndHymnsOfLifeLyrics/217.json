    "v1": [
      "In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,",
      "Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;",
      "Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,",
      "When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,",
      "Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;",
      "Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,",
      "Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "In the field of Jesus there is work for you;",
      "Such as even angels might rejoice to do;",
      "Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,",
      "While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "In the church of Jesus there's a place for you;",
      "Glorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too;",
      "Why then, like a wand'rer, roam with weary pace,",
      "If the church of Jesus holds for you a place?"
    ]
