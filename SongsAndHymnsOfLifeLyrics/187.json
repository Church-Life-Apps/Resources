      "Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,",

    "v5": [
      "Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;",
      "Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;",

      "And make our waiting hearts Thine own."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Command Thy blessing in this hour;",

    "v7": [
      "O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,",
      "May nought in life or death divide",
      "The saints in Thy communion blessed,",
      "That all Thy fulness be expressed."
