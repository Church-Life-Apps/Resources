    "V1": [
      "How deep the Father's love for us,",
      "how vast beyond all measure",
      "That He should give His only Son",
      "to make a wretch His treasure.",
      "How great the pain of searing loss.",
      "The Father turns His face away",
      "As wounds which mar the Chosen One",
      "bring many sons to glory."
    ],
    "V2": [
      "Behold the Man upon the cross,",
      "my sin upon His shoulders.",
      "Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice",
      "call out among the scoffers.",
      "It was my sin that held Him there",
      "until it was accomplished;",
      "His dying breath has brought me life.",
      "I know that it is finished."
    ],
    "V3": [
      "I will not boast in anything:",
      "no gifts, no pow'r, no wisdom.",
      "But I will boast in Jesus Christ:",
      "His death and resurrection.",
      "Why should I gain from His reward?",
      "I cannot give an answer.",
      "But this I know with all my heart:",
      "His wounds have paid my ransom."
