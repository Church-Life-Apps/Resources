      "And can it be that I should gain",

      "'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!",
      "Who can explore His strange design?",

      "'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,",

      "He left His Father's throne above,",
      "So free, so infinite His grace;",
      "Emptied Himself of all but love,",

      "Long my imprisoned spirit lay",
      "Fast bound in sin and nature's night;",
      "Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,",
      "I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;",
      "My chains fell off, my heart was free,",
      "I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.",

      "No condemnation now I dread;",
      "Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!",
      "Alive in Him, my living Head,",
      "And clothed in righteousness divine,",
      "Bold I approach the eternal throne,",
      "And claim the crown, through Christ my own",
      "Bold I approach the eternal throne,",
      "And claim the crown, through Christ my own"
