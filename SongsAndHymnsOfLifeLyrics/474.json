    "v1": [
      "One sat alone beside the highway begging,",
      "His eyes were blind, the light he could not see;",
      "He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows,",
      "Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "From home and friends the evil spirits drove him,",
      "Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;",
      "He cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him,",
      "Then Jesus came and set the captive free."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "\"Unclean! unclean!\" the leper cried in torment,",
      "The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near;",
      "The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim,",
      "Then Jesus came and cast out every fear."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,",
      "For death had come and taken him away;",
      "Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling,",
      "Then Jesus came and night was turned to day."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "So men today have found the Savior able,",
      "They could not conquer passion, lust and sin;",
      "Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,",
      "Then Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within."
    ],
    "c1": [
      "When Jesus comes, the tempter's pow'r is broken;",
      "When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped away.",
      "He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,",
      "For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay."
