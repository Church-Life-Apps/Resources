      "Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine,",
      "My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine;",

      "Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know",

      "Abide in Thee! 'tis thus I only know",
      "The secrets of Thy mind e'en while below\u2014",
      "All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,",
      "All pow'r and fruit, and service for the Lord."
