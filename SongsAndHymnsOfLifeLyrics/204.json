      "I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!",
      "So kind, and true, and tender,",
      "So wise a Counsellor and Guide,",
      "So mighty a Defender!",
      "From Him who loves me now so well,",
      "What pow'r my soul can sever?",
      "Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?",
      "No! I am His forever."
