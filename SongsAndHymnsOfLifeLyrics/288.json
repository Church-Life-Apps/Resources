    "v1": [
      "In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand.",
      "In peace and in vict'ry triumphantly stand;",
      "Let nothing affright thee and nothing dismay,",
      "For Jesus is coming! It may be today."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "In nothing be anxious; on Him roll thy care.",
      "Thy sins were laid on Him, thy sorrows He'll bear;",
      "Carefree and triumphant press on, still to prove",
      "The strength of His arm and the balm of His love."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay",
      "His strength will be thine till the end of the day.",
      "His arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer;",
      "Then wherefore be anxious, press on without fear."
