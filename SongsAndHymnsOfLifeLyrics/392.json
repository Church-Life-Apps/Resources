      "What a Friend we have in Jesus,",
      "All our sins and griefs to bear!",
      "What a privilege to carry",
      "Everything to God in prayer!",

      "Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?",

      "Soon in glory bright unclouded",
      "There will be no need for prayer;",
      "Rapture, praise, and endless worship",
      "Will be our sweet portion there."
