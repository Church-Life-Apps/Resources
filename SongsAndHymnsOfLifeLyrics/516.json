      "Glorious things of thee are spoken,",
      "Zion, city of our God!",
      "He whose word cannot be broken",
      "Formed thee for His own abode;",
      "On the Rock of Ages founded,",
      "What can shake thy sure repose?",
      "With salvation's walls surrounded,",
      "Thou may'st smile at all thy foes."

    "v2": [
      "See the streams of living waters,",
      "Springing from eternal love,",
      "Well supply thy sons and daughters,",
      "And all fear of want remove;",
      "Who can faint, when such a river",
      "Ever flows their thirst t'assauge?",
      "Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,",
      "Never fails from age to age."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Blest constituents of Zion,",
      "Washed in the Redeemer's blood!",
      "Jesus, whom their souls rely on,",
      "Makes them kings and priests to God.",
      "'Tis His love His people raises",
      "Over self to reign as kings:",
      "And as priests, His worthy praises,",
      "Each his thankful off'ring brings."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Savior, if of Zion's city",
      "I, through grace, a member am;",
      "Let the world deride or pity,",
      "I will glory in Thy name.",
      "Fading is the worldling's pleasure,",
      "All his boasted pomp and show;",
      "Solid joys and lasting treasure,",
      "None but Zion's children know."
