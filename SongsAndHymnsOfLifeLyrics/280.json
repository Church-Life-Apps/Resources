      "No mortal tongue can e'er describe",
      "The freedom of the soul,",
      "When passed beyond all earthly bribe",
      "To God's complete control.",
      "All things are his, yes, life, and death,",
      "Things present or to come;",

      "To be our Lord's alone.",
      "O never speak of sacrifice!",
      "A privilege untold",
      "Is to be His at any price,",

      "Arise! the holy bargain strike\u2014",
      "The fragment for the whole.",

      "All things are yours when you are His,",
      "And He and you are one;",
      "A boundless life in Him there is,",
      "Whence doubt and fear are gone."
