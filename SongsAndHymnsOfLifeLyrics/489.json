      "Shine Thou upon us, Lord,",
      "True Light of men, today,",
      "And through the written Word",
      "Thy very self display;",
      "That so from hearts which burn",
      "With gazing on Thy face,",
      "Thy little ones may learn",
      "The wonders of Thy grace."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Breathe Thou upon us, Lord,",
      "Thy Spirit's living flame,",
      "That so with one accord",
      "Our lips may tell Thy name;",
      "Give Thou the hearing ear,",
      "Fix Thou the wand'ring thought,",
      "That those we teach may hear",
      "The great things Thou hast wrought."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Speak Thou for us, O Lord,",
      "In all we say of Thee;",
      "According to Thy Word",
      "Let all our teaching be;",
      "That so Thy lambs may know",
      "Their own true Shepherd's voice,",
      "Where'er He leads them go,",
      "And in His love rejoice."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Live Thou within us, Lord;",
      "Thy mind and will be ours;",
      "Be Thou beloved, adored,",
      "And served with all our pow'rs;",
      "That so our lives may teach",
      "Thy children what Thou art,",
      "And plead, by more than speech,",
      "For Thee with every heart."
