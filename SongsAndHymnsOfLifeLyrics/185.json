    "v1": [
      "Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;",
      "Wean it from earth, through all its pulses move;",
      "Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,",
      "And make me love Thee as I ought to love."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,",
      "No sudden rending of the veil of clay,",
      "No angel visitant, no opening skies;",
      "But take the dimness of my soul away."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?",
      "All, all Thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.",
      "I see Thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.",
      "Oh, let me seek Thee, and, oh, let me find!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;",
      "Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear,",
      "To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;",
      "Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Teach me to love Thee with a virgin love,",
      "One holy passion filling all my frame;",
      "Thus all the riches of Thyself to prove,",
      "My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame."
