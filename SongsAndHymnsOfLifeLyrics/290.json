    "v1": [
      "Oh, trust thyself to Jesus",
      "When conscious of thy sin,",
      "Its heavy weight upon thee,",
      "Its mighty pow'r within:",
      "Then is the hour for pleading",
      "His finished work for thee:",
      "Then is the time for singing,",
      "His blood was shed for me."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Oh, trust thyself to Jesus",
      "When tempted to transgress,",
      "By word or look of anger,",
      "Or thought of bitterness:",
      "Then is the hour for claiming",
      "Thy Lord to fight for thee:",
      "Then is the time for singing,",
      "He doth deliver me."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Oh, trust thyself to Jesus",
      "When daily cares perplex,",
      "And trifles seem so mighty",
      "Thy inner soul to vex:",
      "Then is the hour for grasping",
      "His hand who walked the sea:",
      "Then is the time for singing,",
      "He makes it calm for me."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Oh, trust thyself to Jesus",
      "When thou art wearied sore,",
      "When head or hand refuses",
      "To think or labor more:",
      "Then is the hour for leaning",
      "Upon the Master's breast:",
      "Then is the time for singing,",
      "My Savior gives me rest."
