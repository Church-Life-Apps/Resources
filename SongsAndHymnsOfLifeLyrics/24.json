    "v1": [
      "By Thee, O God, invited,",
      "We look unto the Son,",
      "In whom Thy heart delighted,",
      "Who all Thy will hath done;",
      "And by the one chief treasure",
      "Thy bosom freely gave,",
      "Thine own pure love we measure,",
      "Thy willing mind to save."

    "v2": [
      "O God of mercy\u2014 Father!",
      "The one unchanging claim,",
      "The brightest hopes, we gather",
      "From Christ's most precious name:",
      "What always sounds so sweetly",
      "In Thine unwearied ear,",
      "Has freed our souls completely",
      "From all our guilt and fear."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "The trembling sinner feareth",
      "That God can ne'er forget;",
      "But one full payment cleareth",
      "His mem 'ry of all debt.",
      "When nought beside could free us,",
      "Or set our souls at large,",
      "The death of God's Beloved",
      "Secured a full discharge."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "No wrath God's heart retaineth",
      "To usward who believe;",
      "No dread in ours remaineth",
      "As we His love receive;",
      "Returning sons He kisses,",
      "And with His robe invests;",
      "His perfect love dismisses",
      "All terror from our breasts."
