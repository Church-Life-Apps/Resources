    "V1": [
      "Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present",
      "At Thy table freshly spread,",
      "Seated at Thy priceless banquet",
      "With Thy banner over head.",
      "Precious moments at Thy table,",
      "From all fear and doubt set free;",
      "Here to rest, so sweetly able,",
      "Occupied alone with Thee."
    ],
    "V2": [
      "Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,",
      "Gladly by Thy Spirit led;",
      "Calmly in the blest remembrance",
      "Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.",
      "Lord, we take each simple token",
      "In fond memory of Thee,",
      "Muse upon Thy body broken",
      "And Thy blood shed on the tree."
    ],
    "V3": [
      "Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,",
      "In these chosen emblems   here;",
      "In the bread and wine of blessing\u2014",
      "Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!",
      "Lord, behold us met together,",
      "One in Thee, our risen Head,",
      "Thus we take the cup of blessing,",
      "Thus we share the broken bread."
    ],
    "V4": [
      "Lord, we know how true Thy promise",
      "To be with us where we meet,",
      "When in Thy loved name we gather",
      "To enjoy communion sweet;",
      "Dearer still that looked-for promise",
      "To each waiting, yearning heart,",
      "That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,",
      "Yes, forever where Thou art."
