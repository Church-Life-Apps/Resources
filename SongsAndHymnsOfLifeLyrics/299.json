    "v1": [
      "When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,",
      "When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,",
      "Count your many blessings, name them one by one,",

      "Are you ever burdened with a load of care?",

      "When you look at others with their lands and gold,",

      "So amid the conflict, whether great or small,",
