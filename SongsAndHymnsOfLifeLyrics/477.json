    "V1": [
      "There were ninety and nine that safely lay",
      "In the shelter of the fold,",
      "But one was out on the hills away,",
      "Far off from the gates of gold.",
      "Away on the mountains wild and bare,",
      "Away from the tender Shepherd's care,",
      "Away from the tender Shepherd's care."
    ],
    "V2": [
      "\"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;",
      "Are they not enough for Thee?\"",
      "But the Shepherd made answer:",
      "\"This of Mine has wandered away from Me;",
      "And although the road be rough and steep,",
      "I go to the desert to find My sheep,",
      "I go to the desert to find My sheep.\""
    ],
    "V3": [
      "But none of the ransomed ever knew",
      "How deep were the waters crossed;",
      "Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed thru",
      "Ere He found His sheep that was lost.",
      "Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry\u2014",
      "'Twas sick and helpless and ready to die;",
      "'Twas sick and helpless and ready to die."
    ],
    "V4": [
      "\"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way",
      "That mark out the mountain's track?\"",
      "\"They were shed for one who had gone astray",
      "Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.\"",
      "\"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?\"",
      "\"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn;",
      "They're pierced tonight by many a thorn.\""
    ],
    "V5": [
      "And all thru the mountains, thunder-riv'n,",
      "And up from the rocky steep,",
      "There arose a cry to the gate of heav'n,",
      "\"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!\"",
      "And the angels echoed around the throne,",
      "\"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!",
      "Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own.\""
