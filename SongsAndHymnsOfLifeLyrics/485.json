      "If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,",
      "Were my life worth living for a day?",
      "Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort",
      "In the things that soon must pass away?",
      "If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,",
      "Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?",
      "Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing",
      "For a moment with a Christ-filled life?"

    "v2": [
      "Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,",
      "And a name revered both far and near,",
      "Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,",
      "Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;",
      "If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,",
      "Who endured the cross and died for me,",
      "Could then all the world afford a refuge,",
      "Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?"

    "v3": [
      "O what emptiness!\u2014 without the Savior",
      "'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!",
      "And eternity, how dark without Him!",
      "Only night and tears and endless woe!",
      "What, though I might live without the Savior,",
      "When I come to die, how would it be?",
      "O to face the valley's gloom without Him!",
      "And without Him all eternity!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "O the joy of having all in Jesus!",
      "What a balm the broken heart to heal!",
      "Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,",
      "Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!",
      "If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,",
      "Nothing else in all the world beside\u2014",
      "O then everything is mine in Jesus;",
      "For my needs and more He will provide."
