    "v1": [
      "Hast thou no scar?",
      "No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand?",
      "I hear thee sung throughout the land,",
      "I hear them hail thy shining star,",
      "Hast thou no scar? no scar?"

      "Hast thou no wound?",
      "Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,",

      "Hast thou no wound? no wound?"

    "v3": [
      "No wound? no scar?",
      "Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,",
      "And pierced the feet that follow Me;",
      "But whole? can he have followed far",
      "Who has no wound nor scar?"
    ]
