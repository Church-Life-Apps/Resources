      "How pleasant is the sound of praise!",
      "It well becomes the saints of God;",
      "Should we refuse our songs to raise,",
      "The stones might tell our shame abroad."

      "For Him Who washed us in His blood,",

      "Though angels may with rapture see",
      "How mercy flows in Jesus' blood,",
      "It is not theirs to prove, as we,",
      "The cleansing virtue of this flood."

    "v5": [
      "Though angels praise the heavenly King,",

    "v6": [
      "Sweet truth! It yields unceasing cause",
      "Of wonder and of praise above;",
      "That man, who late accurs\u00e9d was,",
      "Should be the object of such love."
