      "Life out of death\u2014 dear Master, is it spoken",
      "Of the life here, or in the better land?",

      "Life out of death\u2014 a pilgrim path and lonely,",

    "v4": [
      "Life out of death\u2014 blessed mission to be ever",
      "Bearing the living water brimming o'er,",
      "With life abundant from the clear, pure river,",
      "Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more."
