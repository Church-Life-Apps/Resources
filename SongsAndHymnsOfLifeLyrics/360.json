    "v1": [
      "Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me",
      "A living, bright reality,",
      "More present to faith's vision keen",
      "Than any earthly object seen;",
      "More dear, more intimately nigh",
      "Than e'en the closest earthly tie."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "And Thou, blest vision of my soul,",
      "Hast made my broken nature whole;",
      "Hast purified my base desires,",
      "And kindled passion's holiest fires;",
      "My nature Thou hast lifted up,",
      "And filled me with a glorious hope."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Nearer and dearer still to me,",
      "Thou living, loving Savior be;",
      "Brighter the vision of Thy face,",
      "More charming still Thy words of grace;",
      "So, life shall be transformed to love,",
      "A heav'n below\u2014 a heav'n above."
