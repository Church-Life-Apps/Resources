      "Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;",
      "My heart by mighty grace compelled",

      "But since Thou hast Thy love revealed,",

      "If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,",
      "And light'nings flash, to blast my soul,",

      "A bleeding Savior I have viewed,",
      "And now I hate my sin."

    "v4": [
      "Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,",
      "Come, take possession of Thine own,",
      "For Thou hast set me free;",
      "Released from Satan's hard command,",
      "See all my powers waiting stand,",
      "To be employed by Thee."
