    "V1": [
      "A mighty fortress is our God,",
      "A bulwark never failing;",
      "Our helper He amid the flood",
      "Of mortal ills prevailing:",
      "For still our ancient foe",
      "Doth seek to work us woe;",
      "His craft and pow'r are great,",
      "And, armed with cruel hate,",
      "On earth is not his equal."
    ],
    "V2": [
      "Did we in our own strength confide,",
      "Our striving would be losing;",
      "Were not the right Man on our side,",
      "The Man of God's own choosing:",
      "Dost ask who that may be?",
      "Christ Jesus, it is He;",
      "Lord Sabaoth His Name,",
      "From age to age the same,",
      "And He must win the battle."
    ],
    "V3": [
      "And though this world, with devils filled,",
      "Should threaten to undo us,",
      "We will not fear, for God hath willed",
      "His truth to triumph through us:",
      "The prince of darkness grim,",
      "We tremble not for him;",
      "His rage we can endure,",
      "For lo! his doom is sure,",
      "One little word shall fell him."
    ],
    "V4": [
      "That word above all earthly pow'rs,",
      "No thanks to them, abideth;",
      "The Spirit and the gifts are ours",
      "Through Him who with us sideth:",
      "Let goods and kindred go,",
      "This mortal life also;",
      "The body they may kill:",
      "God's truth abideth still,",
      "His Kingdom is forever."
