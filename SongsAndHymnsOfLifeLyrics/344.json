    "v1": [
      "O God, unblessing and unblest,",
      "A withered plant, but not at rest,",
      "A useless cumberer I'm found",
      "Upon Thy field, Thy purchased ground;",
      "And yet I pray\u2014 \"Do not forsake me,",
      "but in Thy hand, O Savior, take me."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "As women take unbroken flax,",
      "As molders take unshapen wax,",
      "As smith, the iron, rough and cold,",
      "A useful instrument to mold,",
      "So in Thy skillful hands O take me,",
      "And never let Thy love forsake me.\""
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Like rock uncrushed, the stubborn will,",
      "Though bearing gold is barren still;",
      "Like marble in the quarry rough,",
      "The natural heart is useless stuff;",
      "And so, I pray\u2014 \"Do not forsake me,",
      "But with Thy hand, O Savior break me."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "As mortars crush the hardest rock,",
      "As hammers break the stony block,",
      "As millstones bruise the finest wheat,",
      "As nuts are broken for their meat,",
      "So with Thy mighty hand, O break me,",
      "And never let Thy love forsake me.\""
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Though crushed and broken, yet I'm nought",
      "But fragments to the furnace brought;",
      "Though bruised, I have no worth to feed",
      "The multitudes that die in need;",
      "And so I pray\u2014\"Do not forsake me,",
      "But meet for service, Savior make me."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "As into useful forms the ore",
      "From molten scraps the molders pour;",
      "As fire doth make the bruis\u00e8d wheat,",
      "When mixed and molded, fit to eat;",
      "So, fit for use by fire, O make me,",
      "And never let Thy love forsake me.\""
