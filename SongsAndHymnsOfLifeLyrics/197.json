      "The Church's one foundation",
      "Is Jesus Christ her Lord;",
      "She is His new creation",
      "By water and the Word:",
      "From heav'n He came and sought her",
      "To be His holy Bride;",
      "With His own blood He bought her,",

    "v2": [
      "She is from every nation,",
      "Yet one o'er all the earth,",

      "One holy Name she blesses,",
      "Partakes one holy food,",
      "And to one hope she presses,",
      "With every grace endued."

    "v3": [
      "'Mid toil and tribulation,",
      "And tumult of her war,",
      "She waits the consummation",
      "Of peace for evermore;",
      "Till, with the vision glorious,",
      "Her longing eyes are blest,",
      "And the great Church victorious",
      "Shall be the Church at rest."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Yet she on earth hath union",
      "With God the Three in One,",
      "And mystic sweet communion",
      "With those whose rest is won:",
      "O happy ones and holy!",
      "Lord, give us grace that we,",
      "Like them, the meek and lowly,",
      "On high may dwell with Thee."
