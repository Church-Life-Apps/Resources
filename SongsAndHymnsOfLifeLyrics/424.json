      "Let me love and not be respected;",
      "Let me serve and not be rewarded;",
      "Let me labor and not be remembered;",
      "Let me suffer and not be regarded.",
      "'Tis the pouring, not the drinking;",
      "'Tis the breaking, not the keeping\u2014",
      "A life suff'ring to seek others' blessing,",
      "A life loving and true comfort giving.",
      "Not expecting pity and concern,",
      "Not accepting solace and applause;",
      "Even lonely, even forgotten,",
      "Even wordless, even forsaken.",
      "Tears and blood my price for the righteous crown shall be;",
      "Losing all, my cost for a faithful pilgrim's life.",
      "'Twas the life, O Lord, that You chose to live",
      "In those days when on earth You walked,",
      "Gladly suff'ring all injuries and loss",
      "So that all might draw near and repose.",
      "I cannot see how much farther I shall go;",
      "Still I press on, knowing there is no return.",
      "Let me follow Your pattern so perfect and true,",
      "Bearing ingratitudes without complaint.",
      "In this time of trial, O my Lord, I pray",
      "that You'd wipe all my hidden tears away;",
      "Let me learn, O Lord, You are my reward,",
      "Let me be others' blessing all my days."
