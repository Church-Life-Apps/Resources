    "v1": [
      "Crown Him with many crowns,",
      "The Lamb upon His throne;",
      "Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns",
      "All music but its own!",
      "Awake, my soul, and sing",
      "Of Him who died for thee,",
      "And hail Him as thy matchless King",
      "Through all eternity."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Crown Him the virgin's Son,",
      "The God incarnate born,",
      "Whose arm those crimson trophies won",
      "Which now His brow adorn;",
      "Fruit of the mystic Tree,",
      "As of that Tree the Stem;",
      "The Root whence flows Thy mercy free,",
      "The Babe of Bethlehem."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Crown Him the Lord of love:",
      "Behold His hands and side;",
      "Rich wounds yet visible above",
      "In beauty glorified;",
      "No angel in the sky",
      "Can fully bear that sight,",
      "But downward bends his burning eye",
      "At mysteries so bright."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Crown Him the Lord of peace,",
      "Whose pow'r a scepter sways",
      "From pole to pole, that wars may cease,",
      "And all be prayer and praise.",
      "His reign shall know no end,",
      "And round His pierc\u00e9d feet",
      "Fair flow'rs of glory now extend",
      "Their fragrance ever sweet."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Crown Him the Lord of years,",
      "The Potentate of time,",
      "Creator of the rolling spheres,",
      "Ineffably sublime.",
      "All hail, Redeemer, hail!",
      "For Thou hast died for me;",
      "Thy praise shall never, never fail",
      "Throughout eternity."
