    "v1": [
      "We limit not the truth of God",
      "To our poor reach of mind,",
      "By notions of our day and sect,",
      "Crude, partial, and confined.",
      "Now let a new and better hope",
      "Within our hearts be stirred:",
      "The Lord has yet more light and truth",
      "To break forth from His Word."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Who dares to bind by his dull sense",
      "The oracles of heav'n,",
      "For all the nations, tongues and climes",
      "And all the ages given!",
      "The universe how much unknown!",
      "That ocean unexplored!",
      "The Lord has yet more light and truth",
      "To break forth from His Word."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Darkling our great forefathers went",
      "The first steps of the way;",
      "'Twas but the dawning yet to grow",
      "Into the perfect day;",
      "And grow it shall, our glorious Sun",
      "More fervid rays afford:",
      "The Lord has yet more light and truth",
      "To break forth from His Word."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "The valleys past, ascending still,",
      "Our souls would higher climb,",
      "And look down from supernal heights,",
      "On all the bygone times;",
      "Upward we press, the air is clear,",
      "And the sphere-music heard!",
      "The Lord has yet more light and truth",
      "To break forth from His Word."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "O Father, Son, and Spirit, send",
      "Us increase from above;",
      "Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts",
      "To comprehend Thy love;",
      "And make us all go on to know",
      "With nobler powers conferred:",
      "The Lord has yet more light and truth",
      "To break forth from His Word."
