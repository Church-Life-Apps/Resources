      "Come, Jesus Lord, with holy fire,",
      "Come, and my quickened heart inspire,",
      "My conscience purged by blood;",

      "Let nothing now my heart divide,",

    "v3": [
      "Now with a quenchless thirst inspire,",
      "A longing, infinite desire,",

    "v4": [
      "My will be swallowed up in Thee,",
      "Light in Thy light still may I see",

      "Let all my quickened heart be love,",
      "My spotless life be praise."
