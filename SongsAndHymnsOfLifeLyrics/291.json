    "v1": [
      "Master how shall I bless Thy name",
      "For tender love to me,",
      "For sweet enablings of Thy grace,",
      "So sov'reign, yet so free,",
      "That taught me to obey Thy word,",
      "And cast my care on Thee?"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "No anxious thought upon thy brow",
      "The watching world should see;",
      "No carefulness! O child of God,",
      "For nothing careful be!",
      "But cast thou all thy care on Him",
      "Who always cares for thee."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,",
      "For this new life so sweet,",
      "For taking all the care I laid",
      "At Thy beloved feet,",
      "Keeping Thy hand upon my heart",
      "To still each anxious beat!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "I long to praise Thee more, and yet",
      "This is no care to me;",
      "If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs",
      "Then I will sing to Thee;",
      "And if my silence praise Thee best,",
      "Then silent I will be."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,",
      "Oh, send me forth, to be",
      "Thy messenger to careful hearts,",
      "To bid them taste and see",
      "How good Thou art to those who cast",
      "All, all their care on Thee."
