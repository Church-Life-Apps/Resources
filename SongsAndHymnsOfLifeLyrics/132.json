      "Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;",
      "Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;",
      "Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,",
      "And all my weariness upon Thee lean."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;",
      "Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;",
      "Here would I lay aside each earthly load;",

    "v3": [
      "I have no help but Thine; nor do I need",

      "It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;",
      "My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "This is the hour of banquet and of song;",
      "This is the heav'nly table spread for me;",
      "Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong",
      "The hallowed hour of fellowship with Thee."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;",
      "The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;",
      "The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,",
      "Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,",
      "Yet, passing, points to the glad feast above,",
      "Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,",
      "The Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love."
