    "v1": [
      "Immortal, invisible, God only wise,",
      "In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,",
      "Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,",
      "Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,",
      "Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;",
      "Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,",
      "Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;",
      "In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;",
      "We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,",
      "And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,",
      "Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;",
      "All praise we would render, O help us to see:",
      "'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Immortal, invisible, God only wise,",
      "In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,",
      "Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,",
      "Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise."
