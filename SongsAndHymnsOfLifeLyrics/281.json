    "v1": [
      "A little bird I am,",
      "Shut from the fields of air,",
      "And in my cage I sit and sing",
      "To Him who placed me there;",
      "Well pleased a prisoner to be,",
      "Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Nought have I else to do,",
      "I sing the whole day long;",
      "And He whom most I love to please",
      "Doth listen to my song;",
      "He caught and bound my wand'ring wing;",
      "But still He bends to hear me sing."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Thou hast an ear to hear",
      "A heart to love and bless;",
      "And though my notes were e'er so rude,",
      "Thou wouldst not hear the less;",
      "Because Thou knowest as they fall,",
      "That love, sweet love, inspires them all."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "My cage confines me round;",
      "Abroad I cannot fly;",
      "But though my wing is closely bound,",
      "My heart's at liberty;",
      "For prison walls cannot control",
      "The flight, the freedom of the soul."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "O it is good to soar",
      "These bolts and bars above!",
      "To Him whose purpose I adore,",
      "Whose providence I love;",
      "And in Thy mighty will to find",
      "The joy, the freedom of the mind."
