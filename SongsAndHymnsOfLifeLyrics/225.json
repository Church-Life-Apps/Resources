      "Come in, O come! the door stands open now;",
      "I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus it was Thou.",

      "'Tis time for Thee, my Savior, O come in!"

    "v2": [
      "Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room;",
      "The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom,",
      "The table empty stands, the couch undressed;",
      "Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest!"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Yet welcome, and tonight; this doleful scene",
      "Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;",
      "This dark confusion e'en at once demands",
      "Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ord'ring hands."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "I seek no more to alter things, or mend,",
      "Before the coming of so great a Friend;",
      "All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill",
      "Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart",
      "A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art;",
      "To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin:",
      "Come, all Thyself, yea come, Lord Jesus, in!"
