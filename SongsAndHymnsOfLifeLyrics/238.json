      "For heav'n-born natures meet;",
      "Give us, for Thee long pining,",

      "Jesus, this feast receiving,",
      "We Thee unseen adore;",
      "Thy faithful word believing,",

      "Give us, Thou true and loving,",
      "On earth to live in Thee;",
      "Then, death the veil removing,",
      "Thy glorious face to see."
