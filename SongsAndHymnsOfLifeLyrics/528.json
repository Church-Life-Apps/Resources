      "Till my journey is complete.",
      "Lord, Your face, O how it guides me;",

      "This is now my aspiration:",
      "Not to grieve Your heart again.",
      "It is You I now beseech Lord,",
      "Hold me close within Your breast;",
      "May Your sweet and loving Person",
      "Ever be my strength and rest."
