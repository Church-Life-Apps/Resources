    "v1": [
      "The name of Jesus is our stand,",
      "It is our victory;",
      "Not on ourselves do we rely,",
      "But, mighty Lord, on Thee.",
      "Our weapons are not arms of flesh,",
      "But ours the Spirit's sword,",
      "And God's whole armor putting on,",
      "We battle in the Lord."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,",
      "Stand firm in one accord!",
      "Though war be fierce and darkness thick,",
      "Resist him in the Lord!",
      "If one through fear should backward turn,",
      "He undermines the rest.",
      "Oh, do not let your brothers down,",
      "Nor by you be distressed."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "The devil knows his time is short,",
      "He is the more enraged,",
      "And by his wiles would weaken us,",
      "Before the battle's waged.",
      "The trials now more num'rous are,",
      "The suff'ring e'en more sore,",
      "The force of hell opposing us",
      "More dreadful than before."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "What should our posture be today",
      "In such a desperate hour?",
      "Should we our ease and pleasure seek",
      "And let the foe devour?",
      "Or with increasing conflict strong,",
      "Courageous to endure?",
      "'Tis here that life or death is won!",
      "Who will God's praise secure?"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "For Christ the Lord we then would stand,",
      "He is the Conqueror!",
      "For Him we would endure the pain",
      "Until the fight is o'er.",
      "The hour of triumph soon we'll see\u2014",
      "The Lord will come again;",
      "If now we suffer for His sake,",
      "Then we with Him shall reign."
