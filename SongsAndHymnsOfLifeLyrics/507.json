      "We may not die, but rise and meet the Lord!",
      "This blessed hope, God shows us in His Word;",
      "The Spirit makes it plain to us His own\u2014",
      "He'll catch us from this world to His own throne."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "We may not die, but rise and meet the Lord!",
      "Oh, the bright glory these few words afford!",
      "Changed instantly, the twinkling of an eye,",
      "And see Thee face to face, our Lord for aye!"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Some shall not die, but rise and meet the Lord,",
      "O precious promise! faithful, true and good!",
      "Although we do not know the day or hour,",
      "We know that He Himself shall come in pow'r."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "We may not die, then let us more pure be,",
      "Cut off each sin, unseen, or that men see,",
      "This world is passing, Heav'n will quickly come,",
      "Then let us day by day be more like Him!"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "We shall arise, and meet Him in the air!",
      "Then let us not entangled be down here!",
      "We look for Christ! We do not look for death!",
      "Our hope at any hour, to leave this earth."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "We shall arise, and to our Lord ascend,",
      "When His victorious shout the air shall rend!",
      "O come! Lord Jesus, Come! His saints now cry,",
      "Come quickly! so, we e'er shall be with Thee."
