      "O blessed Savior, is Thy love",

      "Behold, I give my love, my heart,",
      "My life, my all to Thee."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "I love Thee for the glorious worth",

    "v4": [
      "Though in the very form of God,",

    ],
    "v5": [
      "Thou wouldst like wretched man be made",
      "In everything but sin,",
      "That we as like Thee might become",
      "As we unlike had been:"
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,",
      "In every beauteous grace,",
      "From glory into glory changed,",
      "Till we behold Thy face."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "O Lord, I'll treasure in my soul",
      "The mem'ry of Thy love;",
      "And Thy dear name shall still to me",
      "A grateful odor prove."
