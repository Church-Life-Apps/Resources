      "The Church is Christ's deep longing",
      "And His good pleasure, too.",
      "His every word and action",
      "Is made with her in view.",
      "His heart's love is established,",
      "And naught can Him deter.",
      "Before the earth's foundation",
      "His thoughts were filled with her."

    "v2": [
      "The eve of all creation",
      "He mused on His delight",
      "And pondered every feature",
      "Well-pleasing in His sight.",

      "Proclaiming far and wide",
      "A mind of depth unfathomed",
      "Fixed on a glorious Bride."

    "v3": [
      "And thus His will was 'stablished",

      "Eternally the same.",
      "Though Sin should e'en beguile her,",
      "Then mock her helpless state,",
      "He never could forsake her,",

      "But mercy richly flowed, for",
      "His love was, oh, so vast,",

      "With kindness unsurpassed.",
      "The love which gently drew her \u2014",
      "What mind can comprehend!",
      "Laid down His life, an off'ring;",
      "Sweet fragrance yet ascends."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "And now in resurrection",
      "To her He draws most near;",
      "His own heart's love He pours out",
      "Into her heart so dear.",
      "As she beholds her Bridegroom,",
      "His glory floods her heart,",
      "Till she, His bride, is raptured,",
      "His longed-for counterpart."
