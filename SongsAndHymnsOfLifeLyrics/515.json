      "The Church has waited long",
      "Her absent Lord to see,",
      "And still in loneliness she waits,",
      "A friendless stranger she.",
      "Age after age has gone,",
      "Sun after sun has set,",
      "And still in robes of widowhood,",
      "She weeps a mourner yet."

    "v2": [
      "Saint after saint on earth",
      "Has lived, and loved and died,",
      "And as they left us one by one,",
      "We laid them side by side;",
      "We laid them down to sleep,",
      "But not in hope forlorn\u2014",
      "We laid them but to ripen there",
      "Till the last glorious morn."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "The serpent's brood increase,",
      "The pow'rs of hell grow bold,",
      "The conflict thickens, faith is low,",
      "And love is waxing cold.",
      "How long, O Lord our God,",
      "Holy, and true, and good,",
      "Will You not judge Your suff'ring Church,",
      "Her sighs, and tears, and blood?"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "We long to hear Your voice,",
      "To see You face to face,",
      "To share Your crown and glory then,",
      "As now we share Your grace.",
      "Should not the loving Bride",
      "Her absent Bridegroom mourn?",
      "Should she not wear the signs of grief",
      "Until her Lord return?"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "The whole creation groans,",
      "And waits to hear that voice",
      "That shall her beauteousness restore,",
      "And make her wastes rejoice.",
      "Come, Lord, and wipe away",
      "The curse, the sin, the stain,",
      "And make this blighted world of ours",
      "Your own fair world again."
