      "Lord, I was blind, I could not see",

      "In radiant vision dawns on me."

    "v2": [
      "Lord, I was deaf, I could not hear",

    "v3": [
      "Lord, I was dumb, I could not speak",

    "v4": [
      "Lord, I was dead, I could not stir",
      "My lifeless soul to come to Thee;",
      "But now, since Thou hast quickened me,",
      "I rise from sin's dark sepulcher."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "For Thou hast made the blind to see,",
      "The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,",
      "The dead to live\u2014and, lo! I break",
      "The chains of my captivity."
