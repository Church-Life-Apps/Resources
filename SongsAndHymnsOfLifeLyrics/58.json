    "v1": [
      "O sacred Head, now wounded with grief and shame weighed down;",
      "Now scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown.",
      "How pale Thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn;",
      "How does that visage languish, which once was bright as morn!"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered was all for sinners' gain;",
      "Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain.",
      "Lo, here I fall, my Savior; 'tis I deserve Thy place.",
      "Look on me with Thy favor; vouchsafe to me Thy grace."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest Friend,",
      "For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?",
      "O make me Thine forever; and, should I fainting be,",
      "Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Be near when I am dying, O show Thy cross to me;",
      "And for my succor flying, come, Lord, to set me free.",
      "These eyes, new faith receiving, from Jesus shall not move;",
      "For he who dies believing, dies safely, through Thy love."
