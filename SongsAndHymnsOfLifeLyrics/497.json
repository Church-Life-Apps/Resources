    "v1": [
      "Soldiers of Christ, arise,",
      "And put your armor on,",
      "Strong in the strength which God supplies,",
      "Through His eternal Son.",
      "Strong in the Lord of Hosts,",
      "And in His mighty pow'r,",
      "Who in the strength of Jesus trusts",
      "Is more than conqueror."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Stand then in His great might,",
      "With all His strength endued;",
      "And take, to arm you for the fight,",
      "The panoply* of God,",
      "That, having all things done,",
      "And all your conflicts past,",
      "You may o'ercome through",
      "Christ alone,",
      "And stand complete at last."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Leave no unguarded place,",
      "No weakness of the soul,",
      "Take every virtue, every grace,",
      "And fortify the whole.",
      "To keep your armor bright",
      "Attend with constant care,",
      "Still walking in your Captain's sight",
      "And watching unto prayer."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Pray, without ceasing pray,",
      "Your Captain gives the word;",
      "His summons cheerfully obey,",
      "And call upon the Lord:",
      "To God your every want",
      "In instant prayer display;",
      "Pray always; pray, and never faint;",
      "Pray, without ceasing pray!"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "From strength to strength go on;",
      "Wrestle, and fight, and pray;",
      "Tread all the powers of darkness down,",
      "And win the well-fought day:",
      "Still let the Spirit cry",
      "In all His soldiers, \"Come!\"",
      "Till Christ the Lord descend from high,",
      "And take the conquerors home."
