    "v1": [
      "Your love and affection is sweeter than honey;",
      "Your Name is an ointment most fragrant of all",
      "Refreshing and soothing for me to discover;",
      "Romantic and lovely, desire of all."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "You wandered alone among sad human beings,",
      "You spoke words of grace sharing Your heart of love.",
      "You flowed a true balm that heals all that does ail us.",
      "Despite our poor lack, You came far from above."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Your face like a flint, You held true to Your mission;",
      "Jerusalem's pathway You fearlessly sought.",
      "Fulfilling God's will, You delighted to do it.",
      "Forsaken by God, Your blood ran from the cross."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "You gave all for others, in darkness so hidden;",
      "Your work quite completed, You lay in the grave;",
      "The One who was honored was left alone quickly,",
      "Asleep in a tomb in a desolate cave."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "All hope had just vanished and prospects departed;",
      "The daylight had faded, the earth filled with gloom.",
      "Oh Lord of my life, why so quickly You perished?",
      "Oh Lord of my love, You departed too soon."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Appearing in glory, You were manifested;",
      "The third day Your kindness and love was made known,",
      "The life of res'rrection flows out through Your loving;",
      "The pow'r of ascension, my reality."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "When I gaze upon You, then all else does vanish;",
      "Your sweetness we taste and the world disappears.",
      "I bathe in Your love and I sense Your dear sweetness;",
      "My heart and my soul give to You all my years."
