    "v1": [
      "How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight,",
      "When those who love the Lord",
      "In one another's peace delight,",
      "And so fulfill His Word."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "When each can feel his brother's sigh,",
      "And with him bear a part;",
      "When sorrow flows from eye to eye,",
      "And joy from heart to heart."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "When, free from envy, scorn and pride,",
      "Our wishes all above,",
      "Each can his brother's failings hide,",
      "And show a brother's love."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "When love, in one delightful stream,",
      "Through every bosom flows;",
      "When union sweet, and dear esteem,",
      "In every action glows."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Love is the golden chain that binds;",
      "The saints Thy grace thus prove.",
      "And he is glory's heir that finds",
      "His bosom glow with love."
