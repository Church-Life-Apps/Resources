    "v1": [
      "The Lord is ris'n; and death's dark judgment flood",
      "Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood.",
      "The Lord is ris'n: we stand beyond the doom",
      "Of all our sin, through Jesus' empty tomb."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "The Lord is ris'n: with Him we also rose,",
      "And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.",
      "The Lord is ris'n; beyond the judgment land,",
      "In Him, in resurrection life we stand."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "The Lord is ris'n; and now redeemed to God,",
      "We tread the desert which His feet have trod.",
      "The Lord is ris'n: the sanctu'ry's our place,",
      "Where now we dwell before the Father's face."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "The Lord is ris'n: the Lord is gone before.",
      "We long to see Him, and to sin no more.",
      "The Lord is ris'n: our triumph-shout shall be,",
      "\"Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!\""
