    "v1": [
      "Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me,",
      "As some strong tide it presses on its way,",
      "Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul,",
      "Yearning to sweep all barriers away."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Shall I not yield to that constraining power?",
      "Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?",
      "My God, Thy gentleness has conquered me,",
      "Life cannot be as it has hither been."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Break through my nature, mighty, heav'nly love,",
      "Clear every avenue of thought and brain,",
      "Flood my affections, purify my will,",
      "Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God,",
      "Forth from my life, spontaneous and free",
      "Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace,",
      "Loving, because God loved, eternally."
