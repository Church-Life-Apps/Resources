      "My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,",
      "Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;",

      "So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,",

      "No matter if the way be sometimes dark,",
      "No matter though the cost be oft-times great,",

    "v4": [
      "One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;",
      "One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;",
      "My God, my glory here, from day to day,",
      "And in the glory there my Great Reward."
