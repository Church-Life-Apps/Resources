    "v1": [
      "When I am in the natural man,",
      "How very strong I feel I am,",
      "I do not know, I cannot scan",
      "How very weak I am."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "When in the world I have my life,",
      "I cannot sense my failure rife,",
      "But boasting in my earnest strife,",
      "Proudly, I forward press."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "When I within the darkness dwell,",
      "My shallow state I cannot tell,",
      "I only think how I excel,",
      "Needing no modesty."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "But when at last I come to Thee,",
      "Thy searching light uncovers me,",
      "I see what I could never see\u2014",
      "My ugly self exposed."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Withering beneath Thy scorching ray,",
      "I find my all fading away,",
      "My self-esteem in dust I lay,",
      "My weakness I embrace."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "There's not a thing that pride can claim,",
      "There's not a member but is lame,",
      "There's only deep regret and shame,",
      "O Lord, how can I pray?"
    ],
    "v7": [
      "Thy blood from judgment sets me free,",
      "Thy life from doom delivers me.",
      "How filthy yet I still must be,",
      "In shame my head I bow."
    ],
    "v8": [
      "In blindness I'm puffed up with pride,",
      "Thinking no need the facts to hide.",
      "My self-conceit has multiplied,",
      "While I in darkness boast."
    ],
    "v9": [
      "Whether I stay or move along,",
      "Whate'er I say, I'm always wrong!",
      "So weak am I and never strong,",
      "Nothing I do is right."
    ],
    "v10": [
      "I want to pray, but faith have not,",
      "I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.",
      "Oh, canst Thou e'er renew my heart,",
      "Have mercy, Lord, on me!"
