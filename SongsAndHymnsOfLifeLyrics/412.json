      "\"Within the Veil:\" be this, beloved, thy portion,",

      "\"Within the Veil,\" for only as thou gazest",

      "\"Within the Veil,\" His fragrance poured upon thee,",
      "Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;",
      "\"Within the Veil,\" His hand shall tune the music",
      "Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord."

    "v4": [
      "\"Within the Veil,\" thy spirit deeply anchored,",
      "Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;",
      "\"Within the Veil,\" thy soul with Him united,",
      "Shall live on earth His resurrection life."
