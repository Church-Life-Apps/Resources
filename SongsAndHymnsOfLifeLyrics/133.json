      "Sweet feast of love divine!",

      "Here every welcome guest",

    "v4": [
      "That blood that flowed for sin",

    "v5": [
      "But if this glimpse of love",
      "Is so divinely sweet,",
      "What will it be, O Lord, above,",
      "Thy gladd'ning smile to meet!"
    ],
    "v6": [
      "To see Thee face to face,",
      "Thy perfect likeness wear,",
      "And all Thy ways of wondrous grace",
      "Through endless years declare."
