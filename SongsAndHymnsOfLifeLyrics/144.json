      "A debtor to mercy alone,",

      "My name from the palms of His hands",
      "Eternity will not erase;",
      "Impressed on His heart, it remains",
      "In marks of indelible grace.",
      "Yes! I to the end shall endure,",
      "As sure as the earnest is giv'n;",
      "More happy, but not more secure,",
      "The glorified spirits in heav'n."
