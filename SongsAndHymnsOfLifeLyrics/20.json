      "Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,",

      "Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,",

    "v3": [
      "O Love divine, Thou vast abyss!",

    "v5": [
      "Though heart may fail and flesh decay,",

    "v6": [
      "Until that day, we all confirm,",

    "v7": [
      "We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,",
      "To Thee our all we owe:",
      "The precious Savior, and the pow'r",
      "t makes Him precious too."
