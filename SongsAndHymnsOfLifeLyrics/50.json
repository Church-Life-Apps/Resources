      "I have a Friend, whose faithful love",
      "Is more than all the world to me:",
      "'Tis higher than the heights above,",
      "And deeper than the soundless sea;",
      "So old, so new, So strong, so true;",
      "Before the earth received its frame,",
      "He loved me \u2014 Blessed be His name!"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "He held the highest place above,",
      "Adored by all the sons of flame,",
      "Yet such His self-denying love,",
      "He laid aside His crown and came",
      "To seek the lost, And at the cost",
      "Of heav'nly rank and earthly fame,",
      "He sought me \u2014 Blessed be His name!"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "It was a lonely path He trod,",
      "From every human soul apart;",
      "Known only to Himself and God",
      "Was all the grief that filled His heart,",
      "Yet from the track He turned not back,",
      "Till where I lay in want and shame,",
      "He found me \u2014 Blessed be His name!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Then dawned at last that day of dread,",
      "When desolate, yet undismayed,",
      "With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,",
      "He, Godforsaken, man-betrayed,",
      "Was then made sin on Calvary,",
      "And, dying there in grief and shame,",
      "He saved me \u2014 Blessed be His name!"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Long as I live my song shall tell",
      "The wonders of His dying love;",
      "And when at last I go to dwell",
      "With Him His sovereign grace to prove,",
      "My joy shall be His face to see,",
      "And bowing there with loud acclaim",
      "I'll praise Him \u2014 Blessed be His name!"
