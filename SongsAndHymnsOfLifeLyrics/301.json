    "v1": [
      "O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,",
      "Though all things around us be trying,",
      "Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,",
      "It's better to sing than be sighing."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,",
      "When the darts of the tempter are flying,",
      "For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,",
      "Our singing much more than our sighing."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,",
      "When sickness upon us is stealing,",
      "No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,",
      "For joy is the fountain of healing."
    ],
    "c1": [
      "Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,",
      "it is better to sing than be sighing:",
      "It is better to live than be dying;",
      "So let us rejoice evermore."
