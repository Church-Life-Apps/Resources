      "Hence, through all the changing sea sons,",
      "Trouble, sickness, sorrow, woe,",

      "Love divine shall bring us through;",
      "Soon shall all Thy blood bought children",
      "Round the throne their anthems raise,",
      "And, in songs of rich salvation,",
      "Shout to Thine eternal praise."
