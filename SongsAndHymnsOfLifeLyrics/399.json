      "Come, O Thou Traveler unknown,",
      "Whom still I hold, but cannot see;",
      "My company before is gone,",

      "I need not tell Thee who I am,",

      "In vain Thou strugglest to get free;",

      "Yield to me now, for I am weak,",

      "'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Thou diedst for me!",

    "v6": [
      "Lame as I am, I take the prey;",
      "Hell, earth and sin, with ease o'ercome.",
      "I leap for joy, pursue my way,",
      "And, as a bounding hart fly home,",
      "Through all eternity to prove",
      "Thy nature and Thy name is Love."
