      "Father I know that all my life",
      "Is portioned out for me,",
      "The changes that are sure to come",
      "I do not fear to see;",
      "I ask Thee for a present mind,",
      "Intent on pleasing Thee."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,",
      "Through constant watching wise,",
      "To meet the glad with joyful smiles,",
      "And wipe the weeping eyes,",
      "A heart at leisure from itself,",
      "To soothe and sympathize."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "I would not have the restless will",
      "That hurries to and fro,",
      "Seeking for some great thing to do,",
      "Or secret thing to know;",
      "I would be treated as a child",
      "And guided where I go."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Wherever in the world I am,",
      "In whatsoe'er estate,",
      "I have a fellowship with hearts",
      "To keep and cultivate;",
      "A work of lowly love to do",
      "For Him on whom I wait."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "I ask Thee for the daily strength",
      "To none that ask denied,",
      "A mind to blend with outward life,",
      "While keeping at Thy side;",
      "Content to fill a little space,",
      "If Thou be glorified."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "The briers besetting every path,",
      "They call for patient care;",
      "There is a cross in every lot,",
      "An earnest need for prayer;",
      "A lowly heart that leans on Thee",
      "Is happy anywhere."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "And if some things I do not ask",
      "Among my blessings be,",
      "I'd have my spirit filled the more",
      "With grateful love to Thee;",
      "More careful not to serve Thee much,",
      "But please Thee perfectly."
    ],
    "v8": [
      "In service which Thy will appoints,",
      "There are no bonds for me;",
      "My inmost heart is taught the truth",
      "That makes Thy children free;",
      "A life of self-renouncing love",
      "Is one of liberty."
