      "Do not hide Your face from me, Lord.",
      "Strengthen me to walk aright;",
      "Constantly appear to me, Lord,",
      "Till my journey is complete.",
      "Your radiant face, my only guide\u2014",

    "v2": [
      "Every step has no assurance,",
      "Thorns and thistles all around;",

      "Lord, I know not where You hide.",
      "Lord, by Your presence intimate,",
      "I boldly press toward the goal,",
      "Thus, Lord, may Your precious presence",
      "Stay with me continually."

      "When I seek Your best, Lord Jesus,",
      "Evil self is evident;",
      "When Your will is my intention,",
      "I am ever powerless.",
      "'Tis only by Your glorious self,",
      "That I can lose myself in You;",
      "Thus, Lord, may Your glory always,",
      "Draw me from the earth away."

    "v4": [
      "Lord, do grant me one intention:",
      "Just to gain Yourself alone.",
      "This is now my aspiration:",
      "Not to grieve Your heart again.",
      "Lord, it is You I now beseech,",
      "Embrace me tightly in Your breast;",
      "May Your sweet and loving Person",
      "Ever be my strength and rest."
