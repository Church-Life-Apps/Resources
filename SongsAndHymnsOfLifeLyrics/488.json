      "Go, labor on; spend, and be spent;",
      "Thy joy to do the Father's will;",

    "v2": [
      "Go, labor on: 'tis not for nought;",

    "v3": [
      "Go, labor on; your hands are weak,",
      "Your knees are faint, your soul cast down;",

    "v4": [
      "Go, labor on while it is day,",
      "The world's dark night is hastening on;",
      "Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,",
      "It is not thus that souls are won."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "Men die in darkness at your side,",
      "Without a hope to cheer the tomb;",
      "Take up the torch and wave it wide,",
      "The torch that lights time's thickest gloom."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray;",
      "Be wise the erring soul to win;",
      "Go forth into the world's highway,",
      "Compel the wanderer to come in."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "Press on, and in thy work rejoice;",
      "For work comes rest, the prize thus won;",
      "Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice,",
      "The midnight cry, Behold, I come!"
