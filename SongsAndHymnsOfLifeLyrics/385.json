      "Thy Word is like a garden, Lord,",
      "With flowers bright and fair:",
      "And everyone who seeks may pluck,",
      "A lovely cluster there.",
      "Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine,",
      "And jewels rich and rare",
      "Are hidden in its mighty depths",
      "For every searcher there."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Thy Word is like a starry host:",
      "A thousand rays of light",
      "Are seen to guide the traveler,",
      "And make his pathway bright.",
      "Thy Word is like an armory,",
      "Where soldiers may repair,",
      "And find, for life's long battle day,",
      "All needful weapons there."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "O may I love Thy precious Word,",
      "May I explore the mine,",
      "May I its fragrant flowers glean,",
      "May light upon me shine.",
      "O may I find my armor there,",
      "Thy Word my trusty sword;",
      "I'll learn to fight with every foe",
      "The battle of the Lord."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Word of the ever living God,",
      "Will of His glorious Son;",
      "Without Thee how could earth be trod,",
      "Or heav'n itself be won?",
      "Lord, grant us all aright to learn",
      "The wisdom it imparts,",
      "And to its heav'nly teaching turn,",
      "With simple, childlike hearts."
