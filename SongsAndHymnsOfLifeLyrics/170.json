      "Made free! Made free! O captive!",
      "Bound by the law of sin,",
      "The law of life in Spirit",
      "Will quicken you within.",
      "And counting on the Spirit,",
      "His life shall now control",
      "The members of your body,",
      "The portals of your soul."

    "v2": [
      "Made free! Made free in Jesus:",
      "For crucified with Him,",
      "From center to circumf'rence,",
      "He breaks the pow'r of sin.",
      "No longer act in body",
      "As if it had no \"law\";",
      "His \"law of life\" must govern",
      "All that ran wild before."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Made free! Made free in Jesus:",
      "Deep planted in His death,",
      "He liberates His life pow'r,",
      "And breathes His Spirit's breath.",
      "Then waxing strong in spirit,",
      "With force of quick'ning life;",
      "The soul and body governed,",
      "Its members cease from strife!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Made free! Made free in Jesus:",
      "Joined to the Risen One,",
      "By conflict prayer you triumph,",
      "And claim His vict'ry won.",
      "Freed with His glorious freedom,",
      "Above the darkness rife;",
      "For now the law of sin and death",
      "Is conquered by His life."
