      "When I survey the wondrous cross,",

      "His dying crimson, from His head",
      "Spreads o'er His body on the tree;",

    ],
    "v5": [
      "Were the whole realm of nature mine,",
      "That were an off'ring far too small;",
      "Love so amazing, so divine,",
      "Demands my soul, my life, my all."
