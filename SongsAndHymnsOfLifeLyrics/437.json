      "One day when heaven was filled with His praises,",
      "One day when sin was as black as could be,",
      "Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin\u2014",
      "Dwelt among men, my example is He!"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,",
      "One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;",
      "Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;",
      "Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "One day they left Him alone in the garden,",
      "One day He rested, from suffering free;",
      "Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;",
      "Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,",
      "One day the stone rolled away from the door;",
      "Then He arose, over death He had conquered;",
      "Now is ascended, my Lord evermore."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,",
      "One day the skies with His glory will shine;",
      "Wonderful day, my belov\u00e9d ones bringing;",
      "Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!"
    ],
    "c1": [
      "Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;",
      "Buried, He carried my sins far away;",
      "Rising, He justified freely forever:",
