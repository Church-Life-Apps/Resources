    "v1": [
      "Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;",
      "The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!",
      "When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,",
      "Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;",
      "Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away.",
      "Change and decay in all around I see;",
      "O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!"
    ],
    "v3": [
      "Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;",
      "But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:",
      "Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;",
      "Come, Friend of sinners, and abide with me!"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "I need Thy presence every passing hour:",
      "What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?",
      "Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?",
      "Through cloud and sunshine, O, abide with me!"
    ],
    "v5": [
      "I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:",
      "Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:",
      "Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?",
      "I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!"
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes;",
      "Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:",
      "Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;",
      "In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!"
