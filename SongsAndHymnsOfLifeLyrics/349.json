      "O Jesus, Lord, when Thou on earth",

    ],
    "v2": [
      "They heard Thy voice, beheld Thy form,",
      "Thy beauteous stature unforgot;",

      "But who Thou art, they knew it not."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "As they of old we too are veiled;",
      "We've known Thee long apparently;",

    "v4": [
      "But as the Spirit now Thou art,",

    ],
    "v6": [
      "The Spirit then revealing make",
      "Thyself more real within my heart,",
      "That ear not hear, nor eye may see",
      "How very real to me Thou art."
    ],
    "v7": [
      "When Thou in mercy dost reveal",
      "And give Thyself as Spirit thus,",
      "What in the world can be more real,",
      "More true than what Thou art to us?"
    ],
    "v8": [
      "Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray,",
      "O'erflow my being as a flood,",
      "That every part with glory shine",
      "And everywhere be Thee and God."
    ],
    "v9": [
      "How close we are in such a life,",
      "In one is blended earth with heav'n;",
      "Thy presence sweetly fills our souls;",
      "Our hearts are to Thy praises giv'n."
