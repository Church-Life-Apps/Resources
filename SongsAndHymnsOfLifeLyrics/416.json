    "V1": [
      "On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,",
      "The emblem of suff'ring and shame,",
      "And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best",
      "For a world of lost sinners was slain."
    ],
    "V2": [
      "Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,",
      "Has a wondrous attraction for me;",
      "For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,",
      "To bear it to dark Calvary."
    ],
    "V3": [
      "In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,",
      "A wondrous beauty I see;",
      "For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,",
      "To pardon and sanctify me."
    ],
    "C1": [
      "So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,",
      "Till my trophies at last I lay down;",
      "I will cling to the old rugged cross,",
      "And exchange it some day for a crown."
    ]
