    "v1": [
      "O Lord, when we the path retrace",
      "Which Thou on earth hast trod,",
      "To man Thy wondrous love and grace,",
      "Thy faithfulness to God;"
    ],
    "v2": [
      "Thy love, by man so sorely tried,",
      "Proved stronger than the grave;",

    ],
    "v3": [
      "Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,",
      "'Midst darkness only light,",

      "And in His will delight;"
    ],
    "v4": [
      "Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,",
      "Or suff'ring, shame, and loss,",
      "Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,",
      "Led only to the cross."
    ],
    "v5": [
      "O Lord, with sorrow, and with shame,",
      "We meekly would confess,",
      "How little we, who bear Thy name,",
      "Thy mind and ways express."
    ],
    "v6": [
      "Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind;",
      "We fain would like Thee be,",
      "And all our rest and pleasure find",
      "In learning, Lord, of Thee."
