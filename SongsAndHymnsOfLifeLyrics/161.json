      "Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,",
      "One that never would run dry;",
      "Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,",
      "Nothing seemed to satisfy."

    "v2": [
      "Thru the desert land of sin I roam no more,",

    ],
    "v4": [
      "Here I find a never ending, sure supply,",
      "While the endless ages roll;",
      "To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,",
      "There to bathe my weary soul."
    ],
    "c1": [
      "Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,",
      "Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;",
      "Finding joy and pleasure",
      "In abounding measure,",
      "I am drinking at the Fountain of life."
