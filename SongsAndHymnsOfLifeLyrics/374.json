    "v1": [
      "How marv'lous, how real that my God has entered me.",
      "He's joined with my spirit; one spirit now are we.",
      "My spirit was empty and dead, apart from God",
      "But now I'm revived as God's life is filling me."
    ],
    "v2": [
      "How rich and how full: God Himself abides in me.",
      "He grows in my spirit; we're mingling constantly.",
      "I was in the world; I pursued my earthly dream",
      "I now have experience of His divinity."
    ],
    "v3": [
      "How glorious, divine: God Himself does live in me.",
      "His life saturates me; one person now are we.",
      "So long I have fought and endeavored by myself",
      "To live now is Christ: God Himself lived out of me."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "How heav'nly, mysterious: that God is built in me,",
      "With Him constituted we're dwelling mutually.",
      "I strove with my heart to fulfill the law of God",
      "But now I express all His fine humanity."
    ],
    "c1": [
      "As Spirit He dwells gloriously.",
      "Two spirits are united as one.",
      "Two lives are mingled,",
      "Now God and man",
      "Are incorp'rated as the God-man."
