    "v1": [
      "'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow",
      "The star is dimmed that lately shone;",
      "'Tis midnight in the garden now,",
      "The suff'ring Savior prays alone."

    "v2": [
      "'Tis midnight, and from all removed,",
      "The Savior wrestles lone with fears \u2014",
      "E'en that disciple whom He loved",
      "Heeds not his Master's grief and tears."

    "v3": [
      "'Tis midnight, and for others' guilt",
      "The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;",
      "Yet He that hath in anguish knelt",
      "Is not forsaken by His God."
    ],
    "v4": [
      "'Tis midnight, and from ether-plains",
      "Is borne the song that angels know \u2014",
      "Unheard by mortals are the strains",
      "That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe."
